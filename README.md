# KVM-Concurrent-Hypervisors
Intel VT-x Virtualization experiments with concurrent hypervisors

## Abstract
VT-x is the hardware virtualization support for the x86 architecture, it allows a virtual machine to have near-native performance in terms of execution speed. In this document we introduce a limitation of the current technology as implemented in the Linux Kernel 4.x and we try to get a deeper understanding through some experiments we have conducted.
